Raindrops
=========



This processing code will demonstrate how to create and operate a raindrop game.

Create a raindrop_game tab.

Also this is where you will create a score variable, to keep track of the number of raindrops you caught.

An array of raindrops will also be defined here to indicate the specific number of raindrops wanted.

Here is where the future classes will be used to create the game.

One of those classes will be a raindrop class.

Here we define a raindrop.

It will travel downward till it either goes off screen or is caught by the catcher.

After one or the other occurs the raindrop will appear back at the top (x=0).

Then repeat. 

The catcher is another class which as its name says, it will catch the raindrops.

If the raindrop is caught, a score variable will increase.

The catcher will be at a set y position will the x following the mouse.
